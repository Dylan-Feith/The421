The 421 is a French dicegame.
The following lines describes the rules chosen in this game.
The goal is to have no tokens. There are 21 tokens.

We play in the growing sense of the number of players.
The very first player is randomly chosen.

In the beginning, each player has no token.
This game has two phases. The first one is called "the charge".
It consists in giving out tokens to the players. The second one is
called "the discharge". In each turn of this phase a player gives
a number of tokens to another.
This game ends when a player has no more tokens.

In each turn of each phase, the process is the following: 
The first player of the turn rolls the three dices and he can reroll 
one, two or the three dices two times. The following players can 
reroll maximum as much as the first player.

During the first phase (the charge), at the end of each turn, 
the one who has the weakest combinaison has tokens. The number 
of tokens is defined by the strongest combinaison. This phase 
ends when all the 21 tokens are distributed.
During the second phase (the discharge), at the end of each turn,
The player with the weakest combinaison has tokens from the 
player with the strongest combinaison. The number of tokens is
defined by the strongest combinaison. 

The player with the weakest combinaison starts the next turn.

In the event of a tie, the player who has made the last dice is taken 
into accornt.

Here are the rules to determine the number of given tokens:
If the strongest combinaison of the turn is ... the player with 
the weakest combinaison has : 
421 -> 10 tokens
111 -> 7 tokens
116 or 666 -> 6 tokens
115 or 555 -> 5 tokens
114 or 444 -> 4 tokens
113 or 333 -> 3 tokens
112 or 222 -> 2 tokens
A sequence : 123 or 234... -> 2 tokens
In the order 665 > 664... -> 1 token
